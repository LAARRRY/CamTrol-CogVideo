# CamTrol - CogVideo version / Diffusers version

This is a diffusers-based implementation of [CamTrol: Training-free Camera Control for Video Generation](https://lifedecoder.github.io/CamTrol/). 

The code is revised based on **[diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)** and **can be easily adapted to any diffusers-based models**.

Here we use diffusers-based [CogVideoX-2b](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/cogvideo) as an example to show how to revise the diffusers-based code and turn the video models into camera-controllable ones. Another example in this repo is diffusers-based [SVD](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models/tree/main).

Some results with CogVideoX can be found on the CamTrol [page](https://lifedecoder.github.io/CamTrol/).

Any questions you could also refer to [another repository](https://github.com/LAARRRY/CamTrol).
